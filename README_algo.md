When all shelves are at capacity and a new order comes in, the item to be
discarded is the least-valued item of the overflow shelf or the shelf that the
new item could be placed in.

For example, when the 'hot' shelf and the 'overflow' shelf are both at capacity
when a new 'hot' item is added, then the least-valued item from either the
'overflow' shelf or the 'hot' shelf will be removed and the new item will
be added to whichever shelf removed the item.

If a new 'hot' item is added and the 'hot' and 'overflow' shelves are at
capacity, but 'frozen' or 'cold' shelves still have capacity, an item will
still be removed from 'hot' or 'overflow' shelf and the new item will be added
to that shelf.
The new item will never be added to a shelf that doesn't match it's
specified temperature or fit on the 'overflow' shelf
